## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install andyjakubowski/software/<formula or cask>`

Or `brew tap eth-p/software` and then `brew install <formula or cask>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andyjakubowski/homebrew-software/master/Casks/<cask>.rb
```
